Based on the user's entered time of day, this straightforward Android app makes food recommendations.  When the user enters a time of day (such as "morning" or "afternoon") in a text box, the application displays a selection of meal alternatives along with their costs.  The input displays an error message if it is empty or does not appear at the required times.  A reset button is also included, which removes the input and recommendations.  The software employs a short list of meals for morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon, night, and dessert, which are arranged according to the time of day.  The app shows the name and price of each meal in a clear style after a valid time has been entered.
